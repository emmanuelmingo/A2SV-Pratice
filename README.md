#A2SV Contest Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to various Codeforces contest problems. As part of the A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley) program, I use this space to store and organize my competitive programming solutions.

#Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

Contests/: Solutions grouped by contest rounds

Each contest has its own folder (e.g., Contest_1234/)
Inside each contest folder, problems are named by their Codeforces problem ID 
Problems/: Solutions organized by problem difficulty or topic.


#Languages Used
Python
